# wrangler.toml — Cloudflare Pages + Pages Functions (stable/minimal)
# Project: RETRO DB (static: /public, functions: /functions)

name = "retro-db"
compatibility_date = "2024-11-01"

# Pages will read static outputs from this directory (repo root based)
pages_build_output_dir = "public"

# Notes:
# - DO NOT add Workers-only or legacy keys (main, routes, workers_dev, triggers, [pages], [site], [build], etc.)
# - Functions are auto-detected from /functions at repo root; no extra config needed
# - In Cloudflare Pages dashboard, set Output directory = "public"
# - If Node APIs are absolutely required later, you may add:
#   # compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
